added art drawn by Eric Garcia to replace original art
  rename Crown, Church, Ship, Canon, Knight, Soldier, Pyramid to match names in original to minimize chance of breaking game.
  resize Crown to match saucer dimensions 48px x 21px
  resize Pyramid to match barricade dimensions 42px x 32px
  resize BowArrow to match spaceship dimensions 26px x 16px

To do:
  add to alien class two more aliens, alien4 and alien5
    config.py, ALIEN_FORMATION and ALIEN_SPRITE_NAMES
    alien.py, beginning line 198 with the creation of the list of aliens
  add to spaceship class a sprite for missile, if possible
    config.py
    spaceship.py, beginning at line 65
  add events for a gamepad or joystick if possible
    spaceship.py, beginning at line 138

from Eric:
    Is it too much to set up a hierarchy?
    Crown (saucer)
    Church (alien5)
    Ship  (alien4)
    Canon (alien3)
    Knight (alien2)
    Soldier (alien1)

Done:
add to alien class two more aliens, alien4 and alien5
  config.py, ALIEN_FORMATION and ALIEN_SPRITE_NAMES
  alien.py, beginning line 198 with the creation of the list of aliens

created a branch called fullscreen on GitHub that has correct syntax for FULLSCREEN in main.py line 19. This will require the creation of a KEYUP event to quit the game, or force an unplugging of the Raspberry Pi. I'm not integrating this branch to master yet.

downloaded a pygame script to test gamepads to Raspberry Pi. It was updated for pygame v.2 but appears backward compatible.

Tested USB NES gamepad and it worked.
Tested USB Trooper2 Atari style gamepad and it worked.
this shows a pathway to adding gamepad events to code. I don't know how much time it will take.

new unit test: created a branch on GitHub called scaled; added argument to main.py line 19 "pygame.SCALED"; tested on Raspberry Pi; did not work, we are using pygame v. 1.9 and the SCALED entity is introduced i pygame v.2
